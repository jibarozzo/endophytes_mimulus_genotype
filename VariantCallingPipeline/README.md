## Bioinformatics Pipeline Tutorial for Processing Paired-End ddRAD Data

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to process paired-end ddRAD data from FASTQ to VCF files using scripts and pipelines developed by Findley Finseth and Thom Nelson.

### Prerequisites

1. **Request to Duke University Sequencing Core**
	- Demultiplex libraries by *i7*.

3. **Software and Tools:**
    
    - Unix-based OS (Linux, MacOS)
    - 
    - Stacks
    - Python
    - Additional scripts provided by Findley Finseth and Thom Nelson
2. **Input Data:**
    
    - Paired-end FASTQ files
    - Barcode sequences
3. **Resource Protocol:**
    
    - Fishman Lab Demultiplexing Protocol: [dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bjnbkman](https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bjnbkman)
    - Note: Pay attention to comments left by other users on the protocol.

### Environment and File Preparation (Step 1 - Step 4)

#### Step 1: Initial Preparation
-  Linux/Unix environment: Make sure your are comfortable navigating a Linux/Unix environment. If not, take the time to do so. You will be working in it a lot. 
- Setup your HPC Cypress directory to download/upload the sequence files

An example directory should look like this:
path/to/your/directory/
├── input_data/
│ ├── raw_files/
│ │ ├── CMD1_S19_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz
│ │ ├── CMD1_S13_L001_I1_001.fastq.g
│ ├── working_files/
│ │ ├── CMD1_S19_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz
│ │ ├── CMD1_S13_L001_I1_001.fastq.gz
│ │ └── ...
│ └── metadata/
│ ├── ddrad_barcode_seqs.txt
│ ├── barcode_seqs.txt
│ └── ...
├── scripts/
│ ├── demultiplex/
│ │ ├── rmdup_molbarcodes.py
│ │ ├── flip2BeRAD.py
│ │ ├── flipreads_slurm.sh
│ │ ├── process_slurm.sh
│ │ ├── rmdup_slurm.sh
│ │ └── ...

There will be multiple `working_files` directories. Each represents a multiplexed/pooled library or a "plate" if you will. 

The `metadata` directory has all the information about your libraries. 
**We will see an complete example directory below**


#### Step 2: File Renaming and Organization

- **Renaming Files:** Skip Step 1 in the Fishman Lab Protocol since Duke performs i7 demultiplexing. Rename your files as follows to match the required format:
    
	`mv CMD1_S19_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz CMD1.1.fastq.gz`
    `mv CMD1_S13_L001_I1_001.fastq.gz CMD1-L001.i7.fastq.gz`

    Ensure to make duplicates of the original files before renaming. For example, keep a file in a "RAW" directory.


#### Step 3: Unzipping Files

- **Unzipping Files for Processing:** Unzip only the `rmdup` files before proceeding to Step 3 using the `gunzip` command:
    
    markdown
    
    Copy code
    
    `gunzip *.rmdup.*.fastq.gz`
    

#### Step 4: Barcodes Preparation

- **Barcodes in Step 3 and Step 4:** Barcodes should be formatted differently for each step.
    
    - **Step 3:** Use the "barcode_seqs.txt" file from Caroline's "2_demultiplex" folders.
    - **Step 4:** Barcodes should be embedded within the cut site (e.g., `GGGGAAGAATGCA`).
- **Cleaning Up Barcodes:** Remove hidden characters in the barcode file for `flip2BeRAD.py`:
    
    less
    
    Copy code
    
    `sed 's/[^A-Za-z0-9_.;]//g' ddrad_barcode_seqs.txt > barcode_seqs.txt`

### Demultiplexing (Step 5 and 6)

#### Step 5: Demultiplexing

- **Demultiplexing:** Demultiplexing to individual samples is completed after Step 4.

#### Step 6: Rmdup and Flipreads

- **Separate Scripts:** Create separate `rmdup` and `flipreads` scripts for each library since these tools are not optimized for running libraries in an array.
- **Execution:** Run `flipreads` scripts one at a time to avoid conflicts due to intermediate/output files having the same name.

### Troubleshooting (Step 7)

#### Step 7: Handling Unix Line Breaks

- **File Conversion:** If experiencing issues with executing Unix commands, convert files to Unix line breaks:
    
    Copy code
    
    `dos2unix filename`

### Explanation of Advanced Topics

#### Process_shortreads vs. Process_radtags

- **Reason for Using Process_shortreads:**
    - The `process_shortreads` tool is used because it accommodates the bestRAD protocol, which allows restriction enzymes on either end. The `process_radtags` tool, even with the `--bestrad` option, is less suited for this specific protocol.

#### Understanding .rem Reads

- **Definition of .rem Reads:**
    
    - `.rem.1.fq` contains single-end reads where the paired-end read was discarded.
    - `.rem.2.fq` contains paired-end reads where the single-end read was discarded.
- **Handling .rem Reads:**
    
    - Proceed without using `.rem` reads; use only `.1` and `.2` reads.
